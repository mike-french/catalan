# Bracketings of Arithmetic Expressions

## Problem

Given a simple flat arithmetic expression containing digits and binary operators, generate all possible bracketings of terms and (optionally) evaluate them.

## Input

A string of interleaved single-digit non-zero integers `1-9` and binary arithmetic operators as follows:

| Operation | Character |
|---|---|
| add       | `+` |
| subtract  | `-` |
| multiply  | `x` or `*` |
| divide    | `รท` or `/` |

For example: `7+7รท7+7x7-7`

Note that spaces are not allowed.  
No checks are performed to test if the input is well-formed.

## Output
 
Print all the possible bracketings, one per line.
Optionally append an equals sign and the result of evaluating the expression, or `NaN` if there is a _Divide By Zero_ error.
 
 If the number of operators is n, then the number of lines of output will be the Catalan number for n+1:
 - Catalan Number \[[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)\]
 - Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences \[[A000108](http://oeis.org/A000108)\]

 ## Example
 
 For expression `7+7/7-7` the output should be:
 ```
 (7+(7/(7-7))) 
 (7+((7/7)-7)) 
 ((7+7)/(7-7)) 
 ((7+(7/7))-7)
 (((7+7)/7)-7) 
 ```
 Where there are 3 operators, and C4 = 5, so 5 possibilities.

 The example/0 function is hardcoded with the 5-operator expression: `"7+7รท7+7x7-7"` 
 which generates C6 = 42 lines of output.
 
 ## Solutions
 
 ### Simple Imperative
 
The `brackets` module contains a simple 10-line solution to print all the bracketings.
 
A simple recursive decomposition of the expression:
- iterate over all operators to select a root
- for each root:
  - divide the expression at the chosen operator to give left and right sub-expressions
  - decompose the left and right sub-expressions recursively
  - write each possibility with brackets around each operator expression

The solution is written in an imperative style, with indexed access to lists, as if they were arrays. However, because the output increases so rapidly with n, it is expected that all the input strings will be quite short. The final string concatenation uses the inefficient ++ operator, but again, the strings are short, so it should not be a problem. We could use list construction `[$(|Left] ++ [Op|Right] ++ ...`, but I think `++` is much clearer.

#### Usage:

At the Erlang shell:
```
> c(brackets).
> brackets:run("7+7/7-7"). 
 (7+(7/(7-7))) 
 (7+((7/7)-7)) 
 ((7+7)/(7-7)) 
 ((7+(7/7))-7) 
 (((7+7)/7)-7) 
 ok
 > brackets:example()
 ... __42 lines of output__
 ok
 ```

### Recursive AST
 
The `catalan` module contains a multi-stage solution to print all the bracketings and evaluate the result.
 
The solution comprises:
- Parse the input string to create a list of tokens (input AST).
- For each arithmetic operator: make a rooted term of the form `{ left-arg, operator, right-arg }` 
- For each rooted term: expand to make a tree (output AST), by recursively decomposing each right/left subterm, until all branch nodes are operators, and all leaf nodes are single numerical values.
- For each tree, print an output line:
  - Print the bracketed expression recursively. 
  - Evaluate recursively by combining values according to the arithmetic operators in the branch nodes.
  - Print the result value. 

The code also includes Erlang type annotations, which was an interesting exercise in itself.

#### Usage

At the Erlang shell:
```
> c(catalan).
> catalan:run("7+7/7-7"). 
 (7+(7/(7-7))) = NaN
 (7+((7/7)-7)) = 1
 ((7+7)/(7-7)) = NaN
 ((7+(7/7))-7) = 1
 (((7+7)/7)-7) = -5
 ok
 > catalan:example()
 ... __42 lines of output__
 ok
 ```
